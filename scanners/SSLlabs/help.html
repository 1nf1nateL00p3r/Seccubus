This scanner takes the following parameters:
<ul>
	<li>
		--hosts @HOSTS
		<br>Specification of hosts to scan
	<li>--gradeonly
		<br>Only process the findings that give a grade
	<li>--api (-a)
		<br>- URL of the ssllabs API, defaults to
                    https://api.ssllabs.com/api/v2/
	<li>--sleep
		<br>- Seconds to sleep between polls of the API (default=15)
		Lower then 15 seconds is considered rude and a violation of
		the terms of usage of the API
	<li>--nosslcheck
		<br>- Do not check the validity of the API SSL certificate
         this can be used when the PI is e.g. intercepted by
         a proxy that does not have a recognised SSL certificate
         or when a outdated operating system is used (NOT RECOMMENDED)
	<li>--useragent
		<br>- Use a custom user agent string. Default: seccubus-ssllabs v0.1
            The default user agent string of REST::Client is appended
            to this user agent string
	<li>--no-clear-cache
		<br>- Do not clear the cache of the SSL labs scan engine
        Gives results faster but may be less accurate
	<li>--from-cache
		<br>- Prefer cached results over fresh results (for very
	    quick results)
	<li>--publish
		<br>- Publish the results of this scan on the SSL labs website
    <li>--cdn
        <br>- Since end nodes may vary when using CDN networks, the
              ip addresses of endpoints will be replaced with ipv4 or ipv6
              if endpoints don't give consistent results this will be
              highlighted in the finding text
	<li>--nodelete
		<br>- Don't erase temporary files
	<li>--verbose (-v)
		<br>- Be verbose during execution (repeat to increase verbosity)
	<li>--quiet (-q)
		<br>- Don't print output
</ul>
You must use --hosts @HOSTS

As hostnames enter the domainnames you would normally enter on
https://www.ssllabs.com
<ul>

	<li>@HOSTS is subsituted with the path of a file containig the hosts field
	<li>$WORSKPACE is subsituted with the workspace name
