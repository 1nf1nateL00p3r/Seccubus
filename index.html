        <h3>Why Seccubus?</h3>
        <p>Anyone who has ever used Nessus or OpenVAS will be familiar with one of their biggest drawbacks. They a very valuable tools, but unfortunately it is also very noisy. The time needed to report on the findings of a scan will often be two or three times the time needed to do the actual scan. Seccubus was created in order to more effectively analyze the results of regular vulnerability scans of the same infrastructure.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="how">
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>Seccubus runs vulnerability scans at regular intervals and compares the findings of the last scan with the findings of the previous scan. The delta of this scan is presented in a web GUI when findings can be easily marked as either real findings or non-issues. Non issues get ignored until they change. This causes a dramatically reduction a analysis time.</p>
