Here are the release notes:

    ---
    New features / Issues resolved
    ------------------------------
    With this release Seccubus goes into BETA phase. It also marks the end of
    active development for Seccubus V1 (last current version is 1.5.5)
    Seccubus V1 is still maintained at a minimum level, meaning that if bugs are
    found and they are not too complex to fix, they will be fixed, but no new
    features will be added to the V1 branch of the product.

    GUI rewrite
    -----------
    Old GUI is in /oldstyle
    Complete GUI code was rewritten using JMVC framework
    Those www api calls needed to make this current GUI work have been rewritten
    to JSON
    New, less confusing, layout of Findings screen

    Bigs fixed (tickets closed):
