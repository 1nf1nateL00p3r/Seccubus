title: Still alive…

Although things appear to be quiet, we’re still making progress.

As things are busy here at Schuberg Philis I have not had the time to put much
work into Seccubus as a project. Fortunately that doesn’t mean that there is
no movement!

I have encountered a few bugs in the way AutoNessus currently behaves, all of
which have been logged at
[sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=216367&atid=1037394).

My first priority will be my summer holiday. Hopefully after that I will find
some time to crush these bugs.
