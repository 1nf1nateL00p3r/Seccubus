# Bug tracker switch

Hi, as we are getting ready for the release of the first Alpha verison of
Seccubus v2 we decided to also change the ticketing system from the native
Sourceforge tracker to Trac. Defects, Enhancements, Tasks and Features can be
logged [here](https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/seccubus/report) from now on.
