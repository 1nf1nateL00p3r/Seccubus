title: Seccubus v2.30 - Improved delta engine and import/export tools
---

We just released a new Seccubus version, you can download it [here](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus/releases/latest) 

For my work at [Schuberg Philis](https://www.schubergphilis.com) we wanted to run Seccubus in Docker 
containers. This and inspiration from [Karl Newell](https://hub.docker.com/r/karlnewell/seccubus/) 
caused me to add a Dockerfile (and some other files) to Seccubus so that Seccubus can now be 
run in a docker container. 

In addition I fixed a couple of bugs and changed the ssllabs scanner so it now uses the v3 API endpoint.


v2.30 -  Improved delta engine and import and export tools
==========================================================

One of the things that has been lacking for a while were proper workspace export and import tools. This release adds them and fixes another issue that has been on our whishlist for long, better handling of gone findings reappearing.

Now when a finding that was previously marked as gone reappears in a scan the 'status before gone' is taken into account.

When the 'status before gone' was:
* New - The finding will reappear as new
* Changed - The finding will reappear as changed
* Open - The finding will reappear as open, unless the finding text has changed, then it will reappear as changed
* No issue - The finding wil reappear as no issue, unless the finding text has changed, then it will reappear as changed
* MASKED - The finding will stay MASKED
