---
I just released the tarballs of Seccubus 2.0.alpha2 the RPMâ€™s will follow
shortly. You can download it from the [download
area](https://sourceforge.net/projects/seccubus/files/Seccubus_v2/).

Release notes:

    
    
    2011-04-28 - Seccubus v2.0.alpha2
    
    Today the second Alpha version of Seccubus sees the light of day. As the name
    suggests this is an Alpha release with the associated quality. If you are
    running Seccubus V1 in a production environment we strongly suggest to not move
    to Seccubus V2 unless you have a specific reason to do so.
    
    This second Alpha release addresses some speed issues and some issues with
    Nessus scanning.
