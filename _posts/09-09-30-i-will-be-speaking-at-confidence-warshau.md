title: I will be speaking at Confidence Warshau
---
I have been asked by the organizers of the [Confidence
conference](http://200902.confidence.org.pl/) in Poland to give a [talk on
Seccubus](http://200902.confidence.org.pl/prelegenci/frank-breedijk/) on their
Warshau edition on 19 and 20 november 2009.

Their [lineup of spekers](http://200902.confidence.org.pl/prelegenci/) is
looking good so it promises to be a nice trip to Poland.
