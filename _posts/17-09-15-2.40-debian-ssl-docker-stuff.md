title: Seccubus v2.40 - Various fixes and improvements
---

We just released a new Seccubus version, you can download it [here](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus/releases/latest) 

15-9-2017 - v2.40 - Fixes and improvements
==========================================

This release mainly fixes installation issues on Debian and issue in docker that are due to the PERL5LIB path
that doesn't include the current directory anymore.
It also fixes the issue where people were unable to connect to a Nessus instance with a self signed certificate
that was trigged by altered behaviour of a perl library.
I've also fixed and tweaked the user interface a bit.

------------
* [#539](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus/issues/539) - Status tab will become the default instead of the login tab if there is a config issue
