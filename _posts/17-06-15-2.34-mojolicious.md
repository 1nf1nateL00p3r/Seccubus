title: Seccubus v2.32 - Fixup release of v2.30
---

We just released a new Seccubus version, you can download it [here](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus/releases/latest) 


15-6-2017 - v2.34 - Backend rewritten in Mojolicious
====================================================

The Seccubus backend has been REST-ish ever since release v2.0. This web backend was implemented
via Perl CGI scripts (yes, using CGI.pm). Needless to say something needed to change.

This backend rewrite has been in the making for some time now and we are finally ready to release
it into the wild.

What are the major changes?
* Backend rewritten in [Mojolicious](http://mojolicious.org/)
* Backend API is now REST compliant and located at /api
* There is no need to run an external webserver for Seccubus, it is built into Mojolicious
* Seccubus now has built in user authentication (Default admin password is 'GiveMeVulns!')
* Fixed a lot off old issues
* Unfortunately there is no solid Mojolicious v6/v7 rpms for RedHat/Centos, so we can no longer provide RPMs for those operating systems

Enhancements
------------
* [#411](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus/issues/411) - Ported the backend to Mojolicious and pure REST
* [#448](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus/issues/448) - Allow import and export utility to read config from specific file
