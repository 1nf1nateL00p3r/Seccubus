title: Seccubus v2.4 – Screen updates are back
---
It appears that in my last release I broken Seccubus in a horrible way. When
you updated a finding, the screen wasn’t automatically updated anymore.

This version has one feature, it restores the functionality that I broken.

I’m sorry, here are some ‘kroketten’ to make up for it…
