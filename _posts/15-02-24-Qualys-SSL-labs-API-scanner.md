title: Seccubus now supports scanning via the Qualys SSL labs API
---

Personally I have always been a fan of Ivan RistiÄ‡'s [Qualys SSL labs](https://www.ssllabs.com) a site that allows you to evaluate the quality of your SSL Labs configuraiton and the defacto gold standard when it comes to judging SSL setups.

That is why I added [support for SSL Labs in version 2.9 of seccubus](/2014/08/18/seccubus-v29-now-with-qualys-ssllabs-support/). At that time I implemented the feature by scraping the SSL Labs website.
While scraping wasn't prohibited, is sure was cumbersome and fragile, and it [did actually break](/2015/01/24/Ooops-SSLlabs-scanner-broken/)

Fortune has it that Ivan [release an API for SSL Labs](https://github.com/seccubus/ssllabs-scan/blob/master/ssllabs-api-docs.md) shortly after I released v2.9.

This version of Seccubus has a new SSL Labs scanner plugin that uses the SSL labs API

You can download the new version [here](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus_v2/releases)
