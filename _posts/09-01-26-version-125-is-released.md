title: Version 1.2.5 is released
---
I just uploaded version 1.2.5 to SoureForge.

Besides the usual bug fixes I have introduced a number of new and/or improved
features:

  * On the findings screen there is a new button that opens all selected findings with a single click
  * The install script now takes the â€“bash option which allows you to specify the location of bash
  * CVSS2 base score links are now clickable
  * Updated auto remarks and ignored differences 
  * I have relaxed the Cross Site scripting protection to allow for certain characters in comments

You can download the new release
[here](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=216367).
