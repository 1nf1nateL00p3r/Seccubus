title: Seccubus v2.20 - What is the Issue?
---

28-10-2015 - 2.20 - What is the issue?
======================================

This release introduces a major new feature that has been in my head since the beginning of Seccubus version 2: Issues.

An issue is a sort of trouble ticket that allows you to link multiple findings together, in order to help keeping track of the remediation process.
An issues can be linked to multiple findings (e.g. because you have the same finding across different hosts) and at the same time a single finding can be linked to multiple issue (e.g. multiple certificate issues found in a single finding).

If you want to know more about issue, please see the online documentation at [www.seccubus.com](www.seccubus.com)
