title: Seccubus v2.28 - The Docker edition
---

We just released a new Seccubus version, you can download it [here](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus/releases/latest) 

For my work at [Schuberg Philis](https://www.schubergphilis.com) we wanted to run Seccubus in Docker 
containers. This and inspiration from [Karl Newell](https://hub.docker.com/r/karlnewell/seccubus/) 
caused me to add a Dockerfile (and some other files) to Seccubus so that Seccubus can now be 
run in a docker container. 

In addition I fixed a couple of bugs and changed the ssllabs scanner so it now uses the v3 API endpoint.
