title: First edition of AutoNessus logo
---
When trying to come up with an sexy AutoNessus logo I decided to go old-
school.

    
    
             ___          ^  
              /       (}/   
              |    _   < }--->  
             /_  ~ )___| /  
         /       _//   |_v  
        /__     /       /  
      
    

Yes, that is right ASCII-”art”, allthough I am not much of an artist.

To explain a little bit. The animal on the right is supposed to be a [centaur]
(http://images.google.nl/images?hl=nl&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-
GB:official&hs=Lbs&resnum=0&q=nessus+centaur&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi). The
triangle on the left is the greek symbol delta, representing the delta
reporting that is included in AutoNessus and the other symbol is an hour
glass, representing the scheduled nature.
