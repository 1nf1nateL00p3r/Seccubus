title: My Confidence 2009.02 presentation
---
As you may know I presented on Confidence 2009.02 in Poland on Seccubus (still
called AutoNessus) and the TLS renegotiation gap.

The organisation has released the videos of these presentation on the
[Confidence 2010 site](http://2010.confidence.org.pl/).

The media archive of Confidence 2009.02 is
[here](http://2010.confidence.org.pl/materialy-listopad-2009).

I have local mirrors of my [Seccubus
talk](images/confidence200902/frank_breedijk.avi) and my [TLS renegotiation
talk](https://www.seccubus.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/frank_breedijk1.avi), there originals are
