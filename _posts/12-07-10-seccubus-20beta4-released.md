title: Seccubus 2.0.beta4 released

After a four month hiatus we just released a new Seccubus version. This
version adresses three specific issues:

  * An issue with install.pl that caused the installer to not write all the required files to the www directory
  * Addressed performance issues that were encountered with large databases
  * Fixed an issue with the v1 to v2 converter

Release notes:

10-6-2012 – 2.0.beta4
