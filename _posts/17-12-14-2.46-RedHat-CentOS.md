title: Seccubus v2.46 - Packages for RedHat/Centos 7
---

We just released a new Seccubus version, you can download it from [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/seccubus/releases) or from [GitHub](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus/releases/latest) 

14-12-2017 - v2.46 - RedHat 7 / Centos 7 packages
=================================================
This release adds RPM support for RedHat 7 and CentOS 7. Because Mojolicious and some of its dependancies were not available
as RPM on any of the standard repos for el7 we are also buildign these RPMs as part of our el7 build street now and are
pushing these packages to our [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/seccubus) repository. This makes tweaks like [this one](https://t.co/svO7z1RiRb) by @Ar0xA unneccasary.
