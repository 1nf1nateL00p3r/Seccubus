15-11-2017 - v2.44 - PackageCloud release

This release cleans up technical debt. Package building has been moved from OpenSuse Build Services to CicleCI
and packages now automatically are uploade to [our PackageCloud repositories](https://packagecloud.io/seccubus/).

Here you will find two repositories:

You can configure these repositories on your operating system to include Seccubus upgrades in your regular package updates.
