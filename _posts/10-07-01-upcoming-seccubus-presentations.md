## Seccubus presentations at Hack in the Box Amsterdam, Black Hat USA and
Defcon

Hello, the last couple of months have been rather hecktic for me as you may
have seen from the lack of updates on this site, but that doesnâ€™t mean that
nothing has happened. In the last few months I have given a Seccubus workshop
at the, CCC organized, [SignInt conference in
Cologne](http://events.ccc.de/sigint/2010/wiki/Fahrplan/events/3815.de.html).
An tomorrow I will be presenting a Seccubus [lightning
talk](https://conference.hackinthebox.org/hitbsecconf2010ams/agenda.pdf) at
the Hack in the Box conference in Amsterdam.

At the end of the month I will present Seccubus at two conferences in Las
Vegas, [The Arsenal at Black Hat](https://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-us-10/bh-
us-10-specialevents_arsenal.html) and
[DefCon](http://defcon.org/html/defcon-18/dc-18-speakers.html#Breedijk).
Besides these two events I will also speak at the [Security B-Sides Las
Vegas](http://www.securitybsides.com/BSidesLasVegas) conference on a different
topic.
