title: Seccubus v2.26 - Speed improvements and a whole log of bugfixes
---

We just release a new Seccubus version, you can download it [here](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus_v2/releases)

12-7-2016 - 2.26 - Speed improvements and a whole log of bugfixes
=================================================================
This release is especially interesting for those of you that are working with large result sets.
The number of findigns that is returned is now limited to 200 results by default and can be adjusted
up or down.
A lot of the filter logic has been moved from the Perl backend to more intelligent database queries 
where caching and other optimalisations techniques prevent timeouts when working with larger result
sets.

Additional improvements are done the rpm packaging and the Nessus6 scanner wich now no longer depends
on certain excotic perl modules.

The number of change records that is created and displayed has been reduced and some other more minor 
have been fixed too.
