# Released Seccubus v1.5.5 to correct installer error

Hello I just released Seccubus v1.5.5 which corrects an error in the installer
reported byStephen Stormont in [Ticket #13](https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/seccubus/ticket/13).

Currently this release is only available as tarball, the rpm is expected
shortly.

18-2-2011 Seccubus 1.5.5 - Fixed installer error  
      
If the installer changed files by means of the sed command a new file was  
created which takes the permissions from the system umask. This caused some  
files not to have the correct permissions as reported by Stephen Stormont in  
ticket #13 (https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/seccubus/ticket/13)
