# Seccubus moved its code repository from Concurrent Versioning System (CVS)
to Subversion (SVN)

As a direct result of the [compromise of Source
Forge](https://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-attack-full-report/) last week
the Seccubus project has moved its source code repository from CVS to SVN. As
Sourceforge indicated in their incident report the CVS system of SOurceForge
is one of the oldest parts of the SourceForge systems and will take extensive
time to validate and bring back online. To help the SourceForge team handle
the incident we decided to migrate the code repository to SVN sooner.
