title: Seccubus v2.36 - TestSSL release
---

We just released a new Seccubus version, you can download it [here](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus/releases/latest) 


29-6-2017 - v2.36 - TestSSL.sh release
======================================

This release has been in the making for a long time. In fact the first pull
request for it's main feature was back in June 2016 by our friend and then
colleague Glenn ten Cate.

This release marks the integration of Dirk Wetter's excellent tool testssl.sh
into Seccubus. With testssl.sh you can get a detailed overview of how well
your TLS enabled service is set up. Not just for websites, but for any TCP
service, even those that use STARTTLS.

In addition we introduced the --cdn switch for ssllabs, to reduce noise for
CDN enabled sites, we the ability to dynamically create users via JIT
provisionsing and we added CSRF protection for enhanced security.

To boost future code quality, Perl::Critic testing has been integrated in the
unit testing process.

Besides that we squased some bugs, five of which got introduced in the previous release :(
