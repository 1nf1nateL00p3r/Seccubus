---

Download it [here](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus_v2/releases)

If you installed a new Seccubus install from our 2.11 release your installation might been broken. This new 
release contains the correct database setup. If you have upgraded to 2.11 there should be no issue.

If you want to fix your database manually please run the following SQL statements on your database.

    ALTER TABLE `seccubus`.`scans`
    ADD COLUMN `password` CHAR(255) NULL DEFAULT NULL AFTER `scannerparam`;

SOrry for the inconveiniance.

Information about the 2.11 release is [here](/2014/12/28/Nessus-6-compatibility-release/)
