title: Seccubus v2.50 - Alpine docker containers
---

We just released a new Seccubus version, you can download it from [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/seccubus/releases) or from [GitHub](https://github.com/schubergphilis/Seccubus/releases/latest) 


5-11-2018 - v2.50 - Seccubus Alpine
===================================
This release brings new Alpine based docker containers and fixes a compatibility issue with MySQL/MariaDB version 8 and above.

The change to Alpine as the base images has resulted in a seriously smaller container size. Besides that we've also published specialized containers that are smaller then the default container.
