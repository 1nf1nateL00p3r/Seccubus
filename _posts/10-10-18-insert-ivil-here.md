title: Insert IVIL hereâ€¦.
---
During a very interesting call with [Zate](http://twitter.com/zate), the
author of the [Nessus Bridge for Metasploit](http://blog.zate.org/2010/09/26
/nessus-bridge-for-metasploit-intro/), we worked out the specification for
what will be one of the driving forces behind Seccubus version 2, IVIL, the
**I**ntermediary **V**ulnerability **I**nformation **L**anguage. An XML schema
specifically designed to interchange vulnerability information between
programs. In order to facilitate a discussion and get as much feedback as
possible I have posted most of what we got sofar on the
[CupFighter.net](http://www.cupfighter.net/index.php/2010/10/ivil-an-xml-
schema-to-exchange-vulnerability-information/) blog.
