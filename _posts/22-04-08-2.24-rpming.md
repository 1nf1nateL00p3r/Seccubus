22-04-2016 - 2.24 - RPM and cert improvements
=============================================

Not everything went perfect upgrading the build process, so we had to tweak the RPM a little and fix an error in the UpToDate.pl script.

Enhancements
------------
* [#310] - Root CA for v2.seccubus.com ([LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) is now pinned for the version check
* [#316] - Clarify create database and grant statement in ConfigTest.pl

Bug Fixes
---------
* [#310] - Version check does not like my certificate
* [#311] - RPM: Config could not be found after version upgrade to 2.22
* [#313] - RPM: Seccubus.conf not placed in correct directory (v2.22)
* [#314] - RPM: v2.22 /opt/seccubus/www/dev should not exist
* [#315] - RPM: v2.22 dependancy mysql-server is not installed
