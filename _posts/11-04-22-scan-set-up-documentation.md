title: Scan set up documentation
---
The biggest feedback I got so far on Seccubus v2 is that that a much needed
piece of documentation on how to set up scans was missing.

I have pluged that hole. New documentation if up on our [Seccubus v2
documentation page](documentation/seccubus-v2) and will be present in the docs
directory in the tarbal of new versions.
