# How to install Seccubus?

* For installation on Debian see [Installation on Debian](../12-installation-on-debian)
* For installation on Fedora see [Installation on Fedora](../16-installation-on-fedora)
* For installation from source see [Installation from source](../17-installation-from-source)

## What about RedHat/CentOS

Installation on RedHat/CentOS should be possible using the [Fedora](../16-installation-on-fedora) RPMs. However be aware that it is very hard to find a reliable Mojolicious RPM for RedHat /CentOs. That's why Seccubus is just packaged for Fedora at this moment.
