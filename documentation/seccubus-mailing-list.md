Due to popular demand there is now a Seccubus user mailing list.

To subscribe to the mailing list you can send an email to [seccubus-list-
subscribe@seccubus.com](mailto:seccubus-list-subscribe@seccubus.com) or fill
out the form on [this page](mailing-list/subscribe).

The mailing list archives can be found [here](mailing-list/archive).

Currently the mailing list archives are not indexed by the site search engine,
but I am confident Google will find them in no time.
