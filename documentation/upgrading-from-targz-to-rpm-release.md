title: Upgrading from .tar.gz to .rpm release
---
Please find below the notes on upgrading to the .release from a .tar.gz
release a provided by Peter Slootweg the package maintainer for the rpms.

    
    
    Seccubus is available as rpm starting from version 1.5.0. To be compliant with  
    the LSB, a few changes have to be made to the layout of Seccubus. No problem of  
    course if you're just starting with Seccubus, but if you already have an  
    install, a few changes have to be made.  
      
        /home/seccubus            => /opt/Seccubus  
        /home/seccubus/www        => /opt/Seccubus/www  
        /home/seccubus/bin        => /opt/Seccubus/bin  
      
        /home/seccubus/var        => /var/lib/Seccubus  
        /home/seccubus/etc/config => /etc/Seccubus/config  
      
    Of these, only the 'var' and the 'config' are site specific. If you move your  
    scan data from /home/seccubus/var to /var/lib/Seccubus and update  
    /etc/Seccubus/config to match your /home/seccubus/etc/config, all should be  
    fine.  
    The rpm install adds a config file to apache (/etc/httpd/conf.d/Seccubus.conf).  
    Make sure you remove (or adapt) your previous apache config.
