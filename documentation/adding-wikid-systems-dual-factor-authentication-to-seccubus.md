title: Adding WikID systems dual factor authentication to Seccubus
---
My friends over a [WikiID systems](http://www.wikidsystems.com/) where kind
enough to write an article on [how to add support for their Dual Factor
Authentication solution to Seccubus](http://www.wikidsystems.com/support
/wikid-support-center/how-to/how-to-add-two-factor-authentication-to-the-
seccubus-automated-vulnerability-scanner).

Thanks Nick, it is highly appreciated.
