                    <h1>Skipfish installation for Seccubus v2.5</h1>
                    <p>This post will describe step by step how to configure Skipfish for Seccubus.</p>

<p>You can grab the latest release of Skipfish here:</p>

<p>https://code.google.com/p/skipfish/downloads/list</p>

<p>Before you compile the Skipfish src we need to edit 2 files so Skipfish can be
used in Seccubus.<br />
In my current setup the Seccubus files are located in /opt/seccubus and I’m
going to install the Skipfish in the /opt</p>

<p>Edit the Skipfish config file located in the src/config.h of Skipfish and add
the full path where you want use the Skipfish:</p>

<p>/* Default paths to runtime files: */</p>

<h1 id="define-assetsdir-optskipfishassets">define ASSETS_DIR “/opt/skipfish/assets”</h1>
<p>#define DEF_WORDLIST “/opt/skipfish/skipfish.wl”</p>

<p>/* Default signature file */<br />
#define SIG_FILE “/opt/skipfish/signatures/signatures.conf”</p>

<p>Now make the Skipfish installation and when it’s compiled copy the skipfish
dir to /opt<br />
The last file we need to edit is the /opt/skipfish/signatures/signatures.conf
and add the path prefix:</p>

<h6 id="section">#</h6>
<p>##<br />
## Master signature file.<br />
### The mime signatures warn about server responses that have an interesting<br />
# mime. For example anything that is presented as php-source will likely<br />
# be interesting<br />
include /opt/skipfish/signatures/mime.sigs</p>

<h1 id="the-files-signature-will-use-the-content-to-determine-if-a-response">The files signature will use the content to determine if a response</h1>
<p># is an interesting file. For example, a SVN file.<br />
include /opt/skipfish/signatures/files.sigs</p>

<h1 id="the-messages-signatures-look-for-interesting-server-messages-most">The messages signatures look for interesting server messages. Most</h1>
<p># are based on errors, such as caused by incorrect SQL queries or PHP<br />
# execution failures.<br />
include /opt/skipfish/signatures/messages.sigs</p>

<h1 id="the-apps-signatures-will-help-to-find-pages-and-applications-whos">The apps signatures will help to find pages and applications who’s</h1>
<p># functionality is a security risk by default. For example, phpinfo()<br />
# pages that leak information or CMS admin interfaces.<br />
include /opt/skipfish/signatures/apps.sigs</p>

<h1 id="context-signatures-are-linked-to-injection-tests-they-look-for-strings">Context signatures are linked to injection tests. They look for strings</h1>
<p># that are relevant to the current injection test and help to highlight<br />
# potential vulnerabilities.<br />
include /opt/skipfish/signatures/context.sigs</p>

<p>Skipfish is now installed and ready to use in Seccubus.</p>
