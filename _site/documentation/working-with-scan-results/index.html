editor"> You can fill this form in just as a regular unix
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/5/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> file. Anything after the IP
addres and whitspace is used to describe the host in future sections.</p>

based on their status. <img src="https://www.seccubus.com/wp-%0Acontent/uploads/2008/03/04-two-findings.png" alt="Two findings"> The statusses have tehe following
