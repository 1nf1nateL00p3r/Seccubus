New features / Issues resolved
------------------------------
With this release Seccubus goes into BETA phase. It also marks the end of
active development for Seccubus V1 (last current version is 1.5.5)
Seccubus V1 is still maintained at a minimum level, meaning that if bugs are
found and they are not too complex to fix, they will be fixed, but no new
features will be added to the V1 branch of the product.

-----------
Old GUI is in /oldstyle
Complete GUI code was rewritten using JMVC framework
Those www api calls needed to make this current GUI work have been rewritten
to JSON
